Mini Project for 3rd Semester

Description:
The project has three programs, 1.c which is a program to find integers (positive integer only) where every digit is greater or equal to the digit preceding it (wherever such a preceding digit exists) , 2.c which is a program to find the probability of prime numbers from a given range and main.c , which displays a menu  to select which program to run and runs the required program. Also included is a header file header.h , which includes "1.c" and "2.c" for later use in the main program.

How to Compile And Run:
1. On Codeblocks/Other IDE on the Windows platform:
	Make Sure to Keep all the required files (Source codes and input files) in the same directory. Open the file main.c in the IDE of your choice (Codeblocks is 	        recommended) and build it.  After building the file, a file named main.exe will be in the directory where the source codes were initially present. Open a
	command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file main.exe is. To run the program simply type main followed by the name of your input file and press
	enter.
  
  
2.On the Command Line in a linux based system:
	Make Sure to Keep all the required files (Source codes and input files) in the same directory.Then Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you         placed all the above files.Then issue the following set of commands:
  
  
                                    To compile:
                                    gcc main.c 
                                    
                                    To run:                                   
                                    ./a.out *input.txt
                                    *input filename
